# Jet-Blue-25-Challenge-Power-BI

This README file is for an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing the viability of pursuing the 350,000 True Blue points with the Jet Blue challenge of flying to 20 Jet Blue destination airports. It provides a clear overview of the cost and logistical immensity of the comprehensive travel plan.

About

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to help me understand the logistical plan behind pursuing the challenge goals. The nature of the challenge is that a flyer will receive 150,000 True Blue points after flying to 15 distinct airports, 350,000 True Blue points after flying to 20 distinct airports, and 25 years of Mosaic status after flying to 25 distinct airports. The sweet spot to me is the 350,000 point portion. The dashboard leverages Power BI features such as DAX, writing functions, data modeling, and data visualizations. The dashboard displays the potential planned trips in an Azure map setting so that individual trips can be scrutinized.

Executive Summary

The Points/Miles Problem: I would love to accumulate a vast quantity of True Blue points by flying to visit friends and family. I’ve already flown to 4 destinations and would only need either 11 or 16 more to get enough for future travel plans, specifically converting the points to United miles and booking United Polaris from the west coast to Tahiti for a potential honeymoon trip.

The Solution: I previously built out several itineraries for the various trips I would have to take based off the monthly Jet Blue fare sales. A Power BI dashboard will provide far greater visibility of the comprehensive nature of the challenge. The difficulty lies in finding destinations that do not repeat many destination airports as repeat destination airports do not count.

Next steps: There are a number of trips I could take but the fact remains that I don’t really like flying all that much and a map view of exactly where I would have to go has made me aware of exactly what I would have to do to get the points.

The Impact: I did not have to build many features into this particular dashboard (other than the Azure Map) because a glance at the various ridiculous routes I would have to traverse on the map convinced me not to do it. A far better option would be to accumulate these miles (or similar miles) through credit card sign up bonuses.

Dashboard Features

Jet Blue Trips: This azure map is programmed with the coordinates of the various destination airports. I planned a route timing slider but at the point I saw all of the remaining legs to be flown I didn’t need to perform any more work. Too much flying!

Jet Blue Trips Slicer: This slicer permits a review of individual or a batch of various itineraries.

Total Cost / Total Points: A quick matrix thrown in to display either the total cash/point cost of all of the trips or individual legs of the trips.

Skills Used

Power BI: Azure maps, DAX, writing functions, data modeling, and data visualizations.
